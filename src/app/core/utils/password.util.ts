/**
 * Client-side password hashing for the shared `accounts` collection.
 *
 * There is no backend (Cloud Functions require the paid Blaze plan, which
 * this project intentionally avoids), so this is NOT a substitute for real
 * authentication — it exists purely so a stolen/misconfigured read of the
 * `accounts` collection exposes salted hashes instead of plaintext
 * passwords. The actual enforcement lives in Firestore rules, which reject
 * any account write that doesn't reproduce the correct hash exactly (see
 * firestore.rules in the plannet-wos repo — the shared source of truth for
 * this project's rules).
 *
 * The salt is derived deterministically from the username rather than
 * stored randomly: `accounts` reads are fully blocked (that's the whole
 * point), so the client can never read a stored salt back on a later login
 * attempt — it has to be able to reconstruct it from something it already
 * knows. A salt's job is uniqueness, not secrecy, and the username is
 * already effectively public (it's the Firestore document ID), so this
 * loses nothing versus a random-but-unreadable salt.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: these parameters must stay byte-for-byte identical across:
 *   - this file
 *   - foundry-planner's and alliance-wiki's copies of the same file
 *   - the one-off Node migration script used to hash existing accounts
 * A mismatch means correct passwords will stop matching their stored hash.
 * `accounts` is shared across all of plannet-wos's apps — a superadmin
 * created in one app is a superadmin in this one too.
